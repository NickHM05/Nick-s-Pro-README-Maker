# Nick's Pro ReadMe Generator

## Description
This professional readme generator was made to add readmes to all of the next projects using the node terminal. My motivation for this project was to add readme's to any creations made in github and vs code when needed. The user can devote more time toward working on the project. This streamlines the process of creating the readme file to the project. I learned how to pass data from my functions onto another file as long as it's on the same repo.

## Installation
The user needs to have VS Code installed on their computer. They need to have the latest Node Version installed. The user also needs to make sure inquirer 8.2.4 is installed from node. 

## Usage
The user just has to open the terminal in their vs code and run node index and will be prompted on what they want in their readme file.
